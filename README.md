# ðŸ§  LeetCode Practice

This repository is a personal record of my LeetCode problem-solving journey.  
It includes description, notes, and solutions to help reinforce my understanding of common algorithms and data structures.

## ðŸ’¡ Goals

- Improve problem-solving skills
- Master common patterns (sliding window, DFS/BFS, DP, etc.)
- Prepare for technical interviews

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack

- Python 3
- Jupyter Notebook (for some explanations)

## ðŸ“Œ Notes

- File names follow the format: `problem_number-title`
